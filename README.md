# Rectangle

Rectangle is a window management app based on Spectacle, written in Swift.
Original project: https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle

# Joachim's fork
This fork is for exploring these extra features (in order of priority:
* overlapping layouts
* snap based on where the window edge is, not the cursor
* reserve screen space for alternate docks
